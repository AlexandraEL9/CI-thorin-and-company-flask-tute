________________template inheritance
allows us to inherit code from other templates
by creating a base template using 
                              {% extends 'base.html' %} 
    in a child template

aim to reduce duplicated code   eg- navbar copied repeatedly!

create a base template that can act as the primary page

{% block content %}
{% block content %}

defining a block or area that we can inject content into from other pages

The difference between the percent sign and the double curly bracket notation that we've
used before, is that the double curly brackets contain an 'expression', which is outputting
something either onto the screen, or in this case, into our href.
The curly bracket and percentage are for statements that control the flow of our template, such
as a for-loop, if-statement, or this block element.

within html- remove all non-specific/ repeated content either side of the specific stuff

(% extends "base.html" %)
{% block content %}
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
{% endblock %}
